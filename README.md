# How to Contribute During Hacktoberfest

Welcome to the **OpenGov Africa Hacktoberfest Repository**!  
This repository contains all active Hacktoberfest issues for contributors participating across OpenGov Africa projects.

Please follow these steps carefully to ensure your work qualifies under **Hacktoberfest’s official participation rules**.

---

## Why This Matters

Hacktoberfest celebrates quality open-source contributions — not quantity.  
To ensure your work counts toward Hacktoberfest, please remember:

1. **Your Pull Requests (PRs) or Merge Requests (MRs) must be in a repository tagged with the `hacktoberfest` topic, or have the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.**

2. **Repositories created solely for Hacktoberfest that do not benefit the wider open-source community, or that encourage overly simplistic contributions (such as adding your name to a list or random content), will be excluded.**

In other words:  
We’re here to **build meaningful tools, designs, and data projects for the African civic space** — not filler content.  
**Quality is key.**

---

## Step 1: Pick or Get Assigned an Issue
1. Browse the open issues in **this repository**: [OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest/issues).
2. Find an issue that matches your skill or interest (Design, Tech, Marketing, Research, etc.).
3. Comment under the issue to indicate your interest.
4. Wait for a maintainer to **assign the issue to you** before starting work.
5. Confirm that the issue carries the label **`hacktoberfest`** or **`hacktoberfest-accepted`**.

---

## Step 2: Work in the Correct Team Repository
Actual contributions (code, design, content, research, etc.) should be done in the appropriate **OpenGov Africa team repository**.

| Area | Repository | Example Reference |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Design | [OpenGovAfrica/design](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/design) | `Related to OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest#12` |
| Tech / Development | [OpenGovAfrica/tech](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/tech) | `Related to OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest#12` |
| Marketing | [OpenGovAfrica/marketing](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/marketing) | `Related to OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest#12` |
| Research & Data | [OpenGovAfrica/research](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/research) | `Related to OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest#12` |

If you are working on a **design issue**, for example:
- Go to the **Design Repo**
- Create a new branch
- Complete your assigned task
- Commit and push your changes there

---

## Step 3: Create a Pull Request (PR)
When your work is ready for review:

1. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** in the same team repository.  
2. In your PR description:
   - Reference the related Hacktoberfest issue from this repo.  
     Example:  
     ```
     Fixes OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest#12
     ```
3. Add the label **`hacktoberfest-accepted`** to your PR.  
   This is required for your PR to count toward Hacktoberfest.
4. Request a review from your team lead or assigned reviewer.

---

## Step 4: After Review
- Once your PR is approved and merged:
  - The related issue in this **Hacktoberfest repo** will be closed.
  - Your PR will automatically count as a valid **Hacktoberfest contribution** (per the rules above).
  - Your contribution will help improve open governance tools, data, and visibility across Africa.

## Example Workflow

**Scenario:** You are assigned Issue #12 in this repo titled *“Design a new event banner.”*

1. Comment on Issue #12: “I’d like to work on this.”  
2. Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you.  
3. In the [Design Repo](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/design), create a branch and complete your design.  
4. Open a PR titled:  "Design: Event Banner (Fixes OpenGovAfrica/hacktoberfest#12)"
5. Add the **`hacktoberfest-accepted`** label to your PR.  
6. Request a review from your team lead.  
7. Once merged, your PR will count toward your Hacktoberfest goal.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do **not** open PRs directly in this Hacktoberfest repo — only issues live here.  
- Do **not** start work before being assigned to an issue.  
- Always **reference the issue number** from this repo in your PR description.  
- Always ensure your issue or PR has either the **`hacktoberfest`** or **`hacktoberfest-accepted`** label.  
- Avoid trivial or spammy contributions — these will be rejected and may disqualify you.

---

## Why This Workflow Helps You Qualify
Following this structure ensures that:
- Your work takes place in repositories tagged with `hacktoberfest`.
- Your PRs are linked to issues with **clear purpose and community value**.
- You meet Hacktoberfest’s quality and labeling requirements.
- You earn verified credit for meaningful, reviewable contributions.

By contributing through this workflow, you are **helping build open-source civic tools and data for Africa**, while ensuring your work fully qualifies for Hacktoberfest recognition.

### Creating Your own Issues During Hacktoberfest

Contributors are welcome to create their own issues **if**:
- The issue directly improves or supports an OpenGov Africa project.
- It is meaningful, specific, and has clear value (for example, improving design, documentation, or code quality).
- It can be a fresh addition or idea or it can reference an existing issue or feature in the main OpenGov Africa repos.

Once your issue is created:
1. Add enough detail for others/maintainers to understand what you’re fixing, creating, or improving.
2. Reference the related main repo issue or task (if applicable).
3. Work on your changes in the appropriate repo ie. design tasks in design repo; marketing in marketing etc. Don't see a repo you think we need? **Just ask and tell us why & it can be created.**
4. Submit a PR and request review.
5. A maintainer will review your PR and, if approved, tag it as **`hacktoberfest-accepted`**.

This ensures your contribution qualifies under Hacktoberfest’s rules:
- PRs must be in a repo tagged with the **“hacktoberfest”** topic or have the **“hacktoberfest-accepted”** label.
- Low-quality or spammy PRs are **not counted**.
