# OpenGov Africa — Contributor Tracker Template

**Purpose:** A simple, shareable tracker to record contributors, roles, tasks and completed work. Store this in the organization Drive (or convert to Google Sheet) for live tracking.

**Drive folder (suggested):** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EF5yA7_0STfUdrRYWvRItOtY95bhVVQS

## How to use
1. Add **one row per task per contributor**. If a contributor works on multiple tasks, add separate rows for each task.  
2. Update **Status** as `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Completed`, or `Blocked`.  
3. Use **Priority** to indicate urgency (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`).  
4. Keep **PR / Issue Link** clickable so reviewers can jump directly to contributions.  
5. Update **Completion Date** when PR is merged or task is finished.

## Notes & best practices
- Update weekly or after a PR is merged.  
- Use this tracker for reporting and for Hacktoberfest acceptance validation.  
- Keep rows short and use PR links for detail — don’t duplicate long descriptions here.
