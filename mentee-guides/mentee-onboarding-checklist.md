# Mentee Onboarding Checklist â€“ OpenGov Africa Hacktoberfest 2025

Welcome to OpenGov Africa! This checklist is designed to guide new contributors (mentees) through their first contributions and help them become active participants in our projects. Follow these steps carefully to get started smoothly.

***Contributing to OpenGov Africa projects helps improve transparency, accountability, and civic participation across Africa. Your contributions, no matter how small, make a difference!***

## 1. Set Up Your GitHub Account
- Create a GitHub account if you donâ€™t already have one: [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/join)  
- Use a clear name and profile picture to help other contributors identify you.  
- Set up **two-factor authentication** for account security (optional but recommended).

---

## 2. Find a Project to Contribute To
- Browse OpenGov Africa repositories for open issues.  
- Check labels like `good first issue`, `Hacktoberfest-friendly`, or `documentation`.  
- Review the repository **README** and **contribution guidelines** to understand the project structure.

---

## 3. Fork the Repository
- Go to the repository you want to contribute to.  
- Click the **Fork** button on the top-right corner of GitHub to create your own copy.

## 4. Clone Your Fork Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME
```
- This will download the repository to your local machine so you can start working on it.

---

## 5. Create a Branch
- Always create a new branch for your work.
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-task-name
```
Replace `feature/your-task-name` with a descriptive branch name related to your task.

---

## 6. Make Changes
- Edit files, add content, fix bugs, or improve documentation.

- Follow the coding and documentation standards mentioned in the repository.

- Commit small, logical changes to make review easier.
### Optional: Sync Your Fork with the Main Repository

If youâ€™ve been working for a while, itâ€™s a good idea to update your fork before committing:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
---

## 7. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
```
- Write a clear commit message summarizing your work.

git push origin feature/your-task-name
```
- This uploads your changes to your forked repository.

## 9. Open a Pull Request (PR)
