# ðŸ¥³ Welcome to the OpenGov Africa Hacktoberfest Repository!

We are thrilled you're here to make your first contributions to open source. This repository is specifically designed to help beginners and experienced developers alike participate in **Hacktoberfest**.

## âœ… Rules for Submission (Please Read!)

To ensure your Pull Request (PR) is accepted and counts towards your Hacktoberfest goals, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. High-Quality Contributions Only

We prioritize quality over quantity. Your PR must be meaningful and provide value.

* **Do not submit minor fixes** (e.g., whitespace changes, single-line typo corrections, reformatting) that do not improve clarity or functionality. These will be marked as spam.
* **Contribute Value:** Look for issues labeled `good first issue`, or contribute one of the suggestions below.

### 2. File Organization

To keep the repository clean, please place your contributions into a logical folder:

* **Algorithms:** Add new code snippets for algorithms or data structures to the relevant language folder (e.g., `Python/Algorithms/`).
* **Projects:** Add small, complete utility scripts or simple projects to a new, named folder (e.g., `Projects/Simple-Web-Scraper/`).
* **Documentation:** General guides should go in the root directory.

### 3. Submission Protocol

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally and create a new, descriptive branch for your work (e.g., `git checkout -b add-python-sort`).
3.  **Commit** your changes with a clear message (e.g., `feat: Add Bubble Sort in Python`).
4.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** targeting the `main` branch.
5.  In the PR description, mention that this is for **Hacktoberfest**.

## ðŸ’¡ Where to Start (Easy Ideas)

If you don't see an open issue, here are some quick ideas for a valid contribution:

* **Add an Algorithm:** Implement a common data structure or algorithm (like a Linked List or Binary Search) in a language folder that doesn't have it yet.
* **Create a Utility Script:** Write a small, useful Python or JavaScript script (e.g., a simple file organizer, a random password generator).
* **Improve a README:** If any project folder lacks a `README.md`, create one that briefly explains the project.

We look forward to reviewing your pull request! Happy hacking! ðŸ’»
